Hi and welcome to my website!
<br><br>
I am Jasmine, a Ph.D student in Software Engineering working under the supervision of [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/){:target="_blank"} in the [DAS Lab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"} at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada. 

During my undergraduate studies, I quickly learned that Software Engineering comes with a fair amount of frustration whether it comes from the steep learning curve of complex concepts, never ending CI builds, or the 1000 vulnerability alerts sent by npm after initializing a project. Therefore, research for me is a way to put my experience with these frustrations into practice, and find solutions to alleviate problems related to software performance and maintenance for developers by developers. 

## Research Interests

- Empirical Software Engineering
