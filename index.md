Hi and welcome to my website!

I am Jasmine, a Ph.D student in Software Engineering working under the supervision of [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/){:target="_blank"} in the [DAS Lab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"} at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada. 

During my undergraduate studies, I quickly learned that Software Engineering comes with a fair amount of frustration whether it comes from the steep learning curve of complex concepts, never ending CI builds, or the 1000 vulnerability alerts sent by npm after initializing a project. Therefore, research for me is a way to put my experience with these frustrations into practice, and find solutions to alleviate problems related to software performance and maintenance for developers by developers. 

## Research Interests

- Empirical Software Engineering
- Mining Software Repositories
- Continuous Integration
- Software Ecosystems

## Education

I have spent my first year of university at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM) in Pure and Applied Mathematics. During that time, I took my first ever programming class which made me gain interest in computer science. I transferred to Concordia University where I graduated with a bachelor's degree of Software Engineering. After graduation, I immediately started my Master's degree under the supervision of Dr. Emad Shihab and within the same year, Dr. Shihab kindly gave me the opportunity to fast track to the PhD program which I was very happy to accept.

## Other Interests

**Fitness** 
<br>I started working out in 2019 to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle while spending a lot of time studying. I discovered that not only it was good for my body, but for my mental health as well. I kept this habit ever since and it is now part of my daily routine. No matter how busy I am, I will always take time for a good HIIT session or some cardio. 

**My Pets**
<br>There is not one year of my life that I can remember that I did not have a pet. I had my first very own dog when I was 12 years old. His name was Frimousse and he was my best friend. We did absolutely everything together - from playing hockey and soccer to road trips and travelling. He unfortunately passed away at the age of 15 in 2018. He taught me how to live life to the fullest and be in the moment. Now, I have two pets that keep me company and make me happy: Mona, a cat I picked up on the streets of Montral on my way back from school 2 years ago, and Popeye, a cute, loving Jack Russell who loves peanut butter and long walks! 

**Video Games** 
<br>Playing video games is my favourite way of relaxing. I enjoy a variety of games, but I have a soft spot for Nintendo games. The Super Nintendo was my first console and I have had a preference for Nintendo games ever since. I particularly enjoy puzzle games, JRPGs, and simulation games. Here is an unordered list of my favourite games of all time: 

- TETRIS 99 (Nintendo)
- Animal Crossing New Leaf (Nintendo)
- Animal Crossing New Horizons (Nintendo)
- Ys VIII - Lacrimosa Of Dana (Nihon Falcom)
- Super Mario World (Nintendo)
- Resident Evil 4 (Capcom)
- Minecraft (Mojang)
